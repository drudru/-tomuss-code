BEWARE : these regression tests are quite specials.
They did not tell if the application is working, they tell if
the application give the same result than the last time.

In order to use these regression tests :

   * You checkout a working version of TOMUSS

   * You erase the content of 'Trash' directory (the 'good' snaphots)

   * You run the regression tests.
     It is very long this first time because we must wait a long time to
     be sure that the browser has finished to display the page
     before taking the snapshot.

   * You checkout the next version

   * You run the regression tests ON THE SAME SYSTEM : NO UPGRADE !

If there is GUI change, the tests will fail.

======================
THERE IS SOME PROBLEM
======================

Some tests may fail due to date changes in the snapshots.
Popup are not allowed, we must simulate click.
The only reliable way to do this is to display image markers
on each gui element.

======================
Testing IE from Linux.
======================

In 'test.py' file, you need to:

  * Configure IE lauching.
    It is done by customize the following command in 'test.py'

    rdesktop windows.univ-lyon1.fr \
         -u thierry.excoffier \
         -d UNIV-LYON1 \
         -f \
         -s 'C:/Program Files/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe http://www.univ-lyon1.fr/'

  * Set the 'password' needed to connect to the remote desktop.

======================
    GIT checking
======================

The 'Trash/GIT/checksum' contains the snapshots for the indicated commit.

for each untested commit:
   Launch 3 time the regression test with snapshot from previous commit
   and store the results.

   Store the results

   Remove all bad snapshot, make the others points (sym links) onto
   the good snapshot from the previous commit.


======================
    TO DO
======================
  * epiphany : enlever l'indicateur de chargement qui est trop gros
  * Filters
  * Bookmark
  * ABJ input
  * Master of tables
  * Suivi
  * TT
  * Other table actions
  * Favorites students and UE
  * Actions on favorite

How to click on the right place :

  * Stroke 'Tab' the good number of time.
    Broken on GUI change.

  * Before each table attribute : encode attribute name in a 3x3 square.

    - Do not work with older version of TOMUSS.

    - Do not work on home page.

  * Detect special user interface features :

    + It works for the '+' on the home page

  * Use browser 'Search' feature !
