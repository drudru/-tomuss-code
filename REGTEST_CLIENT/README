BEWARE : these regression tests are quite specials.
They did not tell if the application is working, they tell if
the application give the same result than the last time.

In order to use these regression tests :

   * You checkout a working version of TOMUSS

   * You erase the content of 'Trash' directory (the 'good' snaphots)

   * You run the regression tests.
     It is very long this first time because we must wait a long time to
     be sure that the browser has finished to display the page
     before taking the snapshot.

   * You checkout the next version

   * You run the regression tests ON THE SAME SYSTEM : NO UPGRADE !

If there is GUI change, the tests will fail.

======================
Testing IE from Linux.

In 'test.py' file, you need to:

  * Configure IE lauching.
    It is done by customize the following command in 'test.py'

         -s 'C:/Program Files/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe http://www.univ-lyon1.fr/'

  * Set the 'password' needed to connect to the remote desktop.

======================
    GIT checking (not yet done)
======================

The 'Trash/GIT/checksum' contains the snapshots for the indicated commit.

for each untested commit:
   Launch 3 time the regression test with snapshot from previous commit
